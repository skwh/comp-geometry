# README - Computational Geometry

This repository is for Haskell code related to the University of Denver Computer Science course "Advanced Topics: Computational Geometry," COMP 3704. 

One file in the source, "HomeworkTwo.hs," is for an program related to the second homework assignment.

Another file in the source, "PointLocation.hs," is for my final project, related to point location queries using a trapezoidal map.
